Very confident and understanding of them
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Very confident and understanding of them as well as enjoying the system of processes of elimination that they employ.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Around 5 hours which was on the nose of what I estimated, most of the time was not spent on the challenges surprisingly but absorbing the lessons.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Still need to practice methods and operators specifically employing && and || instead of 'and' and 'or'
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
My questions are more in regards to special methods and such like the possibilities of multiplication and division inside comparison operators - I did use google and research to get my answers but I'm curious as to the official answers and if there was another way I missed.
